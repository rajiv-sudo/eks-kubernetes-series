# Amazon EKS-Kubernetes-Series
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a flexible and highly scalable infrastructure for running and coordinating container workloads across a cluster of machines. Kubernetes simplifies application management, enhances resource utilization, and ensures high availability and fault tolerance in modern cloud-native environments.

Customers prefer using managed Kubernetes services because they offload the complex operational tasks of cluster management, including updates, scaling, and high availability, to cloud providers, allowing teams to focus on developing and deploying applications. Managed Kubernetes also offers enhanced security, reliability, and performance, with the added benefit of cost savings by eliminating the need for in-house Kubernetes expertise and infrastructure maintenance.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications using Kubernetes, offering a highly available and secure platform for running container workloads on AWS infrastructure.

In this series, we will explore different setups, configurations and code modules that show how customers can get started with Amazon EKS and build features and applications.

**Here are the modules available in the series:**
